# Animal Chatbot! 🐾

Hi there! Welcome to the Animal Chatbot project. This is a fun Python program that lets you chat with an "expert" about different animals.

## What It Does 🤖

This chatbot can answer your questions about:

* 🐶 Dogs
* 🐱 Cats
* 🐘 Elephants
* 🐦 Birds
* 🐧 Penguins
* 🦁 Lions

You can ask it things like:

* "Tell me a fact about dogs."
* "What do cats eat?"
* "How do elephants help each other?"
* "Why do birds sing?"

It will give you fun facts and answers!

## How to Run It 🚀

1.  **Make sure you have Python:** If you don't have Python installed on your computer, you can download it from the official Python website (python.org). Ask an adult to help you if you're not sure how!
2.  **Save the code:** Copy the Python code we made and save it as a file named `animal_chatbot.py`.
3.  **Open your Terminal or Command Prompt:** This is like a special window where you can type commands.
4.  **Go to the folder where you saved the file:** Use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder.
5.  **Run the chatbot:** Type `python animal_chatbot.py` and press Enter.
6.  **Start chatting!** Ask the chatbot questions about animals.
7.  **To stop:** Type "bye" or "goodbye".

## What You Can Do 🛠️

* **Add more animals:** You can add more animals to the `animal_data` dictionary. Just add their names, facts, responses, and questions.
* **Add more questions and answers:** You can add more questions and answers to the existing animals.
* **Make it more fun:** Try adding more silly or interesting responses!
* **Try to make it look better:** If you are feeling extra creative, you can try to make the output look nicer.

## What I Learned 💡

By building this chatbot, I learned about:

* How to use Python dictionaries to store information.
* How to use `if` and `for` loops to control the flow of the program.
* How to use `random.choice()` to pick random responses.
* How to use `try-except` to handle errors.
* How to create a simple chatbot.

## Have Fun! 🎉

I hope you enjoy playing with the Animal Chatbot! If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
